# Golf Performance Analysis Tests

This directory contains unit tests for the golf performance analysis functionality.

## Running Tests

To run the tests:

```bash
deno test
```

## Test Coverage

The tests cover:
- Club type detection
- Search term extraction
- Outcome metric identification

## Adding New Tests

When adding new test cases:
1. Create a new test file in __tests__ if testing a new module
2. Follow the existing pattern of creating test cases
3. Include both positive and negative test cases
4. Test edge cases and boundary conditions

## Performance Optimization

The golf performance analysis has been optimized for better performance:

1. **Memoization**: Search term extraction now caches results to avoid redundant processing
2. **Efficient Data Structures**: Using Map instead of repeated string comparisons
3. **Reduced Function Calls**: Minimizing expensive operations like string transformations
4. **Single-pass Processing**: Performing multiple checks within single data passes

## Edge Function Best Practices

To ensure optimal performance of the Edge Functions:

1. Keep function sizes small and focused
2. Use background tasks for non-critical processing
3. Implement proper error handling and timeouts
4. Cache computationally expensive results
5. Use efficient data structures for lookups and comparisons
